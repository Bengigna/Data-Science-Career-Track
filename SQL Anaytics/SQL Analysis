 -- Investigating a Drop in User Engagement
 
 /* The possible drop could be due to many resasons. Some of the possibilities include internet
outage, public events and holidays, broken features in log in, not able to accessing the website
and others. These hypothesis are tested using the info in the given tables */ --1) To track the trend of the growth:

SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day',created_at) AS day,
       COUNT(*) AS all_users,
       COUNT(CASE
                 WHEN activated_at IS NOT NULL THEN u.user_id
                 ELSE NULL
             END) AS activated_users
FROM tutorial.yammer_users u
WHERE created_at >='2014-06-01'
  AND created_at < '2014-09-01'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1


##### Second SQL

/* To figure out whether loggin from different devices had some differences in patterns*/

SELECT DATE_TRUNC('week',occurred_at) AS week,
       COUNT(DISTINCT y.user_id) AS active_users_weekly,
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN Y.device IN ('dell inspiron notebook','mac mini','hp pavilion desktop','macbook pro','lenovo thinkpad','macbook air',
          'asus chromebook','dell inspiron desktop','acer aspire notebook','acer aspire desktop') THEN y.user_id ELSE NULL END) AS PC,
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN y.device IN('samsung galaxy note','amazon fire phone','iphone 5','samsung galaxy s4','nexus 5','iphone 5s','iphone 4s','nokia lumia 635',
       'htc one') THEN y.user_id ELSE NULL END) AS my_phone,
       COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN y.device IN('nexus 10','kindle fire','windows surface',
        'samsumg galaxy tablet','ipad air','nexus 7','ipad mini') THEN y.user_id ELSE NULL END) AS my_tablet
FROM tutorial.yammer_events y
  WHERE y.event_type='engagement'
  AND y.event_name='login'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
       
#### Third SQL

/* let us see the pattern of each email's action*/

SELECT DATE_TRUNC('week', occurred_at) AS week,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN y.action = 'email_clickthrough' THEN y.user_id ELSE NULL END) AS clickthrough_emails,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN y.action = 'sent_reengagement_email' THEN y.user_id ELSE NULL END) AS reengagement_emails,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN y.action = 'sent_weekly_digest' THEN y.user_id ELSE NULL END) AS emails_weekly,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN y.action = 'email_open' THEN y.user_id ELSE NULL END) AS email_opens
  FROM tutorial.yammer_emails y
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY 1
